Sentinel Driver Installation

NOTE: This driver will only operate green (FLEXID=7-x) hardware keys.  If you do not have a
green hardware key, this setup will not install the proper drivers.


To install driver:

Run "setup.exe" from this directory.  The executable will run the appropriate executable
file based on your operating system and install the necessary files for the Sentinel green
hardware key.
